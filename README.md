A project to investigate the applicability of deep learning to music generation.

## Specifics
Music notation contains a large number of similarities to language.
It is probable that neural networks used for NLP can be applied to music.
This project will investigate different types of neural networks and their usefulness in music generation.
If the project is successful enough, a web application will be created making use of the findings.
