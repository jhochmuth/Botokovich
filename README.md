A project to investigate the applicability of deep learning to music generation.
Please note: this project is still in an early experimental stage.

## Specifics
Music notation contains a large number of similarities to language.
It is probable that neural networks used for NLP tasks can be applied to music. In fact, many successful results have already been documented in a number of papers.
This project will investigate different methods of generating music and evaluate their success.
If the project leads to generated music that is successful enough, a web application will be created making use of the trained models.
